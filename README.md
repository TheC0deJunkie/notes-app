# Notes App

Hey there! üëã Welcome to project #6 in my journey of building 30+ JavaScript projects. This is a simple yet functional notes application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Why This Project?

I'm on a mission to strengthen my foundational web development skills. After spending time with Flutter, Next.js, and WordPress, I felt the need to get back to basics. This project is part of my portfolio-building journey, where I'm creating over 30 JavaScript projects from scratch.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Local storage persistence
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Responsive design

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Personal Note

This project was built entirely by me, with zero AI assistance in the coding process (though I did get AI help for this README üòâ). While I won't be maintaining this project post-publication, feel free to fork it and make it your own!
